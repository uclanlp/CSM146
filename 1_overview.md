#### Course Description
Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to use and understand human languages. Recently, NLP techniques have been widely used in many applications including machine translation, question answering, and extracting information from text. In this course, we will cover the fundamental elements and recent research trends in NLP. Tentative topics include syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and NLP applications as well as the underlying machine learning methods that widely used in modeling NLP systems. The activities of the course include lectures, paper presentations, quizzes, a critical review report, and a final project.

Tentative topics include:

* Machine learning background: linear classification models, basic structured prediction models
* Syntactic analysis: part-of-speech tagging, chunking, dependency parsing, constituency parsing.
* Semantics: brown clusters, vector-space semantics, semantic role labeling.
* NLP Applications: name entity recognition, machine translation, information extraction.
#### Prerequisites: 
Students are expected to have taken a class in linear algebra and in probability and statistics and a basic class in theory of computation and algorithms. Programming experience is necessary for the final project.
