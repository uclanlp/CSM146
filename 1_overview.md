#### Course Description

Machine Learning encompasses the study of algorithms that learn from data. It has been a key
component in a number of problem domains including computer vision, natural language processing,
computational biology and robotics. This class will introduce the fundamental concepts and
algorithms in machine learning (supervised as well as unsupervised learning) as well as best
practices in applying machine learning to practical problems. The class consists of lectures, problem
sets that contain mathematical and programming exercises and two in-class exams.

#### Prerequisites

Undergraduate level training or coursework in algorithms, linear algebra, calculus and multivariate
calculus, basic probability and statistics; an undergraduate level course in Artificial Intelligence may
be helpful but is not required. A background in programming will also be necessary for the problem
sets; specifically students are expected to be familiar with python and scikit-learn (a machine
learning package for python) or learn it during the course.

While there is not one textbook that covers all the material from this course, readings will come from
the following texts:
  * [A course in machine learning](http://ciml.info/index_0_9.html): by Hal Daume III, which will be referred to as CIML (freely
available online ) is the primary reference. We will use version 0.9 of CIML.
