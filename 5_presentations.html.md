The purpose of this project presentation is to allow students to practice giving research talks in front of others. 
Imaging that you're presenting your work at a conference in front of people having basic understanding about NLP.

### Presentation date
Each group has at most 4 students. .

### Preparation 
Each presentation is 30~40 min (every group member has to present at least 5 min).
Students are required to prepare the slides by themselves (you cannot use slides from the original authors directly). However, feel free to use the motivative examples or
some parts of slides from the original authors (with a proper credit to the resources). Some papers are complicated, and you don't have to cover every part of the paper. 
Try to make your presentation simple and focus 
on the big ideas of the papers. Draw connections and provide background of the papers. Please don't spend much time on talking about experimental results. 


### Grading

40% technical understanding, 40% presentation, 20% interaction.
