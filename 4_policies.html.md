## Grading Policy

Each student's grade is calculated as follows:
- 30% final project (5% Proposal + 20% Final report writing, 5% presentation)
- 20% paper summary
- 20% paper presentation
- 20% mid-term exam
- 10% attendence/participations

In general, we will **not** curve your score.

## Late Policy
The submission site will be closed 1hr after the deadline. No late submission will be accepted (unless emergency). 

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
To insure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed from the beginning, 
students with disabilities who require assistance to participate in this class 
are asked to see me as soon as possible.
We aim to be as accommodating and fair as possible.

## Collaboration and use of outside resources
Discussion and collaboration are encouraged. However, students must write their own reports.
When using outside resources, proper citation is necessary. This includes papers, text books, softwares, websites, and helps from others. 
For the details of Honor Code, please refer to [UCLA Student Conduct](http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Student-Conduct-Code#).
If you have any doubt, please check with me in advance. You may get F in the final letter grade if we detect any cheating.
