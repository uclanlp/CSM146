## Grading Policy

Each student's grade is calculated as follows:
- 40% Problem set
   * Problem sets are due at 11:59 pm on the due date.
   * All solutions must be clearly written (or typed) ; unreadable answers will not be graded. We encourage using LaTeX to type out answers.
   * Solutions will be graded on both correctness and clarity. If you cannot solve a problem completely, you may get more partial credit by identifying the gaps in your argument than by attempting to cover them up.
   * Problem set 0 and the math mini-quiz will not be graded. However, you need to submit both. We will not grade any other problem sets/exams unless you attempt problem set 0 and math mini quiz.
- 60% Exams (Mid-term: 25%, Final: 35%)

In general, we will **not** curve your score.

## Late Policy
24hr late credits for the entire quarter, thatâ€™s it. After that, no late submission will be accpeted. (For special situation, please contact TAs and the instructor).

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
To insure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed from the beginning, 
students with disabilities who require assistance to participate in this class 
are asked to see me as soon as possible.
We aim to be as accommodating and fair as possible.

## Collaboration and use of outside resources
Discussion and collaboration are encouraged. However, students must write their own reports.
When using outside resources, proper citation is necessary. This includes papers, text books, softwares, websites, and helps from others. 
For the details of Honor Code, please refer to [UCLA Student Conduct](http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Student-Conduct-Code#).
If you have any doubt, please check with me in advance. You may get F in the final letter grade if we detect any cheating.
